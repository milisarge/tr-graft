Introduction

   Graft provides a mechanism for managing multiple packages under a
   single directory hierarchy. It was inspired by both Depot (Carnegie
   Mellon University) and Stow (Bob Glickstein).

   For the purposes of this discussion a package is defined as a suite of
   programs and files that make up an individual product. For example, the
   package known as gcc consists of the compiler and preprocessor
   programs, include files, manual pages and any other associated file or
   program. The concept of a package should not be confused with some
   vendor's definitions that are - by this definition - actually
   collections of packages.

   Special thanks to Gordon Rowell, Charles Butcher, Charlie Brady and
   Robert Maldon for design suggestions and contributions.
     __________________________________________________________________

Rationale

   In any reasonably large environment, many software packages will be
   installed. The installation location for these packages usually follows
   one of three rationales - each with its own advantages and drawbacks:
    1. Each package is isolated from all other packages by installing it
       into a self contained directory tree. All binaries, manual pages,
       library and configuration files are stored under a single directory
       tree. This directory tree contains NO other files which are not the
       exclusive domain of the package in question.
       This method makes package demarcation obvious. As each package is
       self contained, identification of any file within a package is
       immediately apparent.
       Multiple versions of packages can be installed fairly easily to
       accommodate acceptance testing of new versions and/or legacy
       systems.
       However, the use of individual package directories can lead to VERY
       long $PATH and $MANPATH environment variables. Some shells may not
       be able to handle such long variables. Whenever a new package is
       added, each user MUST update their $PATH and $MANPATH to make the
       package available.
    2. Packages are installed under a common directory tree. Binaries for
       all packages are grouped in a single directory, manual pages for
       all packages in another directory and so on.
       This method eliminates the need for continually updating long $PATH
       variables for each user. As soon as a package is placed into the
       common 'bin' directory it is immediately available to all users
       (after a shell rehash if necessary).
       However, when a package is to be updated it is often very difficult
       to isolate all the files related to a particular package if they
       are intermingled with unrelated files.
    3. A combination of methods (1) and (2).

   In an effort to maximise the advantages and minimise the disadvantages,
   Depot, Stow and Graft adopt a similar philosophy:

     Packages are installed in self contained directory trees and
     symbolic links from a common area are made to the package files.

   This approach allows multiple versions of the same package to co-exist
   on the one system. One version is the commonly available version and
   symbolic links will be made to this version. New versions can be tested
   and once acceptable can replace the current commonly available version.
   Older versions can still be used for legacy systems by using the 'real'
   path name to the package instead of the 'common' path name.

   The size and complexity of environment variables such as $PATH and
   $MANPATH is minimised because only the common area is required. Any
   special cases can also be accommodated but these will usually be in the
   minority when compared with the number of commonly available packages.
     __________________________________________________________________

Research

   Note: Development of Graft began in late 1996. The comments regarding
   the packages listed below reflect their functionality and behaviour at
   that time and may not necessarily reflect their current functionality
   and behaviour.

   As stated earlier, Graft was inspired by Depot and Stow. Both these
   systems were examined and finally rejected for the following reasons:

   Depot
          Depot is very flexible yet cumbersome.

          It requires a database file to be created which provides a
          snapshot of the current state of both the package repository and
          the Depot target. It is possible to inadvertently destroy the
          package repository if the database is damaged.

          Depot assumes "ownership" of the target area, making it almost
          impossible to accommodate packages that are not under the
          control of Depot. ("Ownership" in this case means that Depot
          assumes ALL files in the target area will be under the control
          of Depot. It does not imply that Depot modifies Unix file
          permissions).

          Because of Depot's assumed ownership it is difficult for other
          packages not under the control of Depot to be placed in the same
          target area.

          Depot attempts to impose a fixed package repository relative to
          the package target. It assumes that all packages will be stored
          under 'dir/depot/package' and the target will be 'dir'. This can
          be overridden on the command line but the internals of Depot
          make this mechanism cumbersome.

          Depot is written in C and there are many source files in its
          distribution. Local modifications would be difficult to quickly
          implement and test.

   Stow
          Stow is a stateless system. It requires no database or
          configuration information.

          Like Depot, it assumes that the package repository will be
          stored under 'dir/stow/package' and the target will be 'dir'.
          This can be overridden on the command line and works well during
          the install phase.

          Stow assumes "ownership" of the target area, making it difficult
          to accommodate packages that are not under the control of Stow.
          ("Ownership" in this case means that Stow assumes ALL files in
          the target area will be under the control of Stow. It does not
          imply that Stow modifies Unix file permissions).

          Because of Stow's assumed ownership it is difficult for other
          packages not under the control of Stow to be placed in the same
          target area. When deleting packages, Stow examines everything in
          the target directory - whether it is associated with the package
          it is trying to delete or not. This can be time consuming and
          potentially dangerous as empty directories are also removed -
          even empty directories that do not belong to the package being
          removed.

          Stow has a clever feature of folding and unfolding directories.
          It attempts to optimise the number of symbolic links by making
          links to directories if the directory is only associated with a
          single package. If at a later date Stow discovers another
          package that needs that directory it will unfold that directory
          into a collection of symbolic links to files rather than a
          single symbolic link to the directory. Stow will fold the
          directory when removing packages if the remainder of the
          directory is only concerned with a single package. While clever,
          this feature is probably a waste of time and effort. It means
          that the entire package target must be scanned to determine
          package ownership of links and as packages will usually be
          replaced by newer versions a directory fold will probably be
          short lived.

          Stow will sometimes miss potential conflicts when run in show
          only mode. The conflicts may occur when a directory is unfolded
          and will not show up in show only mode.

          Stow's author suggests that packages be compiled such that they
          refer to files in the target location rather than the actual
          package installation directory. This approach precludes the use
          of multiple versions of packages with different configuration
          and/or library files.

          Stow is written in Perl and is only a few hundred lines of code
          so local modifications can be accommodated. However there are
          very few comments in the code which makes the process of
          modification difficult.

   Since the release of Graft 1.6, the existence of yet another packaging
   program has been brought to the author's attention.

   Encap
          Encap grew out of work begun at the University of Illinois
          Champaign-Urbana. It has the same underlying philosophy as
          Depot, Stow and Graft - encapsulate packages into self contained
          directories and use symbolic links to make them visible in a
          common location.

          Encap uses a combination of a csh wrapper and a Perl program to
          accomplish its work. Like both Depot and Stow, Encap assumes
          that all compiled packages will live under a single directory
          hierarchy - by default 'dir/encap/package'. It then attempts to
          create a symbolic link tree for ALL the packages under this
          area. There doesn't appear to be any easy way to support the
          quick addition or removal of a single package.

          A new release of Encap incorporating many new features was
          expected to be available in early 1997, however no release
          greater than version 1.2 has been forthcoming.

          One good feature of Encap is the ability to exclude specific
          files from the package tree. This concept has been incorporated
          into Graft 1.7 and above.

   Since the release of Graft 2.3, the existence of several another
   packaging programs have been brought to the author's attention. Rather
   than outline their features and whether or not the author feels they
   are superior (or inferior) to Graft, a reference to each package and a
   brief description is given and further research is left as an exercise
   for the reader:

          "stowES (stow Enhancement Script) is a Perl script which tries
          to ease the use of the "stow" packaging program and software
          which can be compiled and installed with autoconf. It automates
          the compilation and installation of software packages and
          provides some useful functions to maintain your stow packages
          (e.g., list packages, check packages for integrity, etc.)."

          "opt_depot is a suite of Perl scripts which makes it easy to
          manage installed software across a wide range of client systems.
          opt_depot makes it possible to keep all files associated with a
          program together in one directory, so installation and
          de-installation is simple. opt_depot is easy to manage, and
          provides a scheme for installing software in a truly portable
          fashion; packages may be installed locally on client systems, or

Design

   This brings us to Graft. Graft has been designed to use the best
   features of Depot, Stow and Encap while maintaining as simple a
   mechanism as possible. The principles of Graft are:
     * Graft will allow packages to be grafted from any directory to any
       other directory. Default installation and target directories will
       be used but can easily be overridden on the command line.
     * Graft will log its actions to a log file. The log file can be
       specified on the command line. If not specified on the command line
       a default log file will be used.
     * Graft will NOT create symbolic links to directories. If a directory
       does not exist in the target tree it will be created (with the same
       ownership and permissions as the original if desired).
     * Graft will create symbolic links with full pathnames rather than
       relative pathnames. This allows easy identification of true package
       locations and facilitates block movement of a target tree without
       the need for Graft deletion and re-installation.
     * Graft will cease installation of a package if a conflict arises. A
       conflict is defined as one of the following conditions:
          + If the package object is a directory and the target object
            exists but is not a directory.
          + If the package object is not a directory and the target object
            exists and is not a symbolic link.
          + If the package object is not a directory and the target object
            exists and is a symbolic link to something other than the
            package object.
     * Installation conflicts will always be reported. Conflicts will be
       reported to standard error.
     * Graft will attempt to display all possible operations when asked,
       even when asked not to perform the operations.
     * Graft will not delete directories when uninstalling. Graft will
       print an appropriate message if an empty directory results and
       leave the deletion for the operator to perform outside the scope of
       Graft's operations. This ensures that place holder directories that
       may be used by other packages are not inadvertently removed. This
       feature can be permanently disabled by setting a flag in the
       Makefile. It can also be temporarily disabled using a command line
       option.
     * Graft will continue to delete the remainder of a package after a
       conflict arises. This maximises the amount of deletion that can be
       performed.
     * Deletion conflicts will always be reported. Conflicts will be
       reported to standard error.
     * Graft will only concern itself with files relating to the package
       at hand. This will allow other packages to be placed in the target
       area without fear of intervention by Graft.
     * Graft will only allow the superuser to install or delete packages.
       This feature can be permanently disabled by setting a flag in the
       Makefile or it may be overridden by a command line option.
     * If the file .nograft exists in any package directory, Graft will
       bypass that directory and any subdirectories during installation.
       The name of this file is specified in the Makefile.
     * When installing a directory tree, if the file .graft-exclude exists
       in any package directory, Graft will assume that the file contains
       a list of file and/or directory names - one per line - which
       correspond to files and/or directories in the directory containing
       the .graft-exclude file. These files and/or directories will NOT be
       grafted. The name of this file is specified in the Makefile.
       The .nograft file takes priority over the .graft-exclude file.
     * When installing a directory tree, if the file .graft-include exists
       in any package directory, Graft will assume that the file contains
       a list of file and/or directory names - one per line - which
       correspond to files and/or directories in the directory containing
       the .graft-include file. ONLY the files and/or directories listed
       in the .graft-include will be grafted. The name of this file is
       specified in the Makefile.
       The .graft-exclude file takes priority over the .graft-include
       file.
     * If the file .nograft exists in any package directory, it will be
       ignored and Graft will continue processing the directory and any
       subdirectories during deletion.
     * If the file .graft-exclude exists in any package directory, its
       contents will be ignored and Graft will continue processing the
       directory and any subdirectories during deletion.
     * If the file .graft-include exists in any package directory, its
       contents will be ignored and Graft will continue processing the
       directory and any subdirectories during deletion.
     * As an aid to transitioning systems to Graft, Graft will allow
       conflicting files to be pruned. This pruning can take the form of a
       file rename or a file removal depending on either a Makefile flag
       or a command line option. If file removal is selected and the file
       is a non-empty directory, it will be renamed instead.
     * If the file .nograft exists in any package directory, it will be
       ignored and Graft will continue processing the directory and any
       subdirectories during pruning.
     * If the file .graft-exclude exists in any package directory, its
       contents will be ignored and Graft will continue processing the
       directory and any subdirectories during pruning.
     * If the file .graft-include exists in any package directory, its
       contents will be ignored and Graft will continue processing the
       directory and any subdirectories during pruning.
     __________________________________________________________________

History

   Development on Graft began in October 1996. The initial design used a
   configuration file to map the installed location of each package to its
   target directory (that is the directory in which the symbolic links
   would be created). Work proceeded at a regular pace and by November
   1997 Graft version 2.1 was released. In this, and all subsequent
   versions, the configuration file had been removed in favour of using
   default source and target directories.

   No further work was performed until September 2000 when the concept of
   bypassing or including files and directories using .nograft or
   .graft-include files was introduced in Graft version 2.3.

   Again nothing changed until February 2002 when Rod Whitby identified a
   bug in the handling of .graft-include files. Several other users (Peter
   Bray, Robert Maldon and others) also reported some deprecation warnings
   when using Graft with Perl version 5.6.0. Graft version 2.4 was the end
   of Graft development for over a decade.

   In May 2015 Matias A. Fonzo contacted the author wishing to use Graft
   in the [33]Dragora Linux distribution. Matias' usage of Graft lead to
   Graft version 2.5 in June 2015 whereby the -P command line option was
   silently ignored if the effective user was not root.

   Since the release of Graft version 2.4 the author's Perl code had
   improved somewhat so Graft version 2.6 released in July 2015
   represented a major clean up of coding style and internals. No new
   behaviours or features were added to the 2.6 release.
     __________________________________________________________________

Installation

   Before installing Graft you'll need Perl 5.x. Graft version 2.x
   requires features only available with Perl 5.x and will not run with
   Perl 4.x.

   Your operating system and its file system(s) should also support
   symbolic links. If you can't make symbolic links then you can't use
   Graft! Graft will exit gracefully if your version of Perl does not
   support symbolic links. It will also exit gracefully if you attempt to
   graft a package into a file system that does not support symbolic links
   - from a Linux ext4 file system into an vfat file system for example.

   Follow these instructions to install Graft:
    1. Unpack the gzipped Graft distribution:
    gunzip -c graft-2.6.tar.gz | tar xvf -

    2. change directories to the Graft distribution directory:
    cd graft-2.6

    3. Create an writable version of the Makefile by running the command
    make -f Makefile.dist

       You'll see output similar to
    cp Makefile.dist Makefile
    chmod 644 Makefile

    ######################################################
    #                                                    #
    #       You'll now need to modify the Makefile       #
    #      variables to suit your local conditions.      #
    #                                                    #
    ######################################################

    make: *** [Makefile] Error 1

       You can ignore the error message. That is just there to prevent the
       creation of the graft executable before you've made your site
       specific configurations to the Makefile.
    4. Edit the Makefile. The following variables should be modified to
       suit your local requirements:

PACKAGEDIR      = /pkgs
TARGETDIR       = /pkgs

                These two variables control your default package
                installation and target directories. Most sites will
                probably choose to install packages under a common
                installation directory and then graft them into a common
                target directory.

                If no specific target directory is given on the command
                line, Graft will use the default value specified by
                TARGETDIR. If a target directory is given on the command
                line but is not fully qualified, the value specified by
                TARGETDIR will be prepended to the command line argument.

                Package names provided to Graft that are not fully
                qualified will have the value specified by PACKAGEDIR
                prepended to the command line arguments.

TOP             = $(PACKAGEDIR)/graft-$(VERSION)
BIN             = $(TOP)/bin
MAN             = $(TOP)/man
DOC             = $(TOP)/doc

                There should be no need to modify these values unless you
                wish to install Graft into a directory that is different
                from your default package installation directory. If you
                do modify TOP you should not change the values of BIN, MAN
                and DOC. If you feel you must change these values then
                perhaps you've misunderstood the concept behind Graft so a
                re-read of this document may be in order.

PERL            = /usr/bin/perl

                This variable refers to the location of the Perl 5.x that
                will be used by the Graft executable. If you plan on
                grafting Perl then this value should be the grafted
                location of Perl rather than the installation location of
                Perl. If you are using an operating system that comes with
                Perl 5.x - such as RedHat or Ubuntu Linux - then you don't
                need to worry about grafting Perl so the value of PERL
                should reflect its installed location.

                Most Unix, Linux and other Unix like operating systems
                ship with Perl these days so modifying this value is
                probably unnecessary.

BUILDPERL       = $(PERL)

                Perl is required during the make. You'll only need to
                change this if the current installed location of Perl is
                different to the future grafted location of Perl.

LOGFILE         = /var/log/graft

                Graft logs all of its actions to a log file. Modify the
                value of LOGFILE to suit your local needs. An alternative
                name can be specified on the command line.

                If you want logging disabled by default, set the value of
                LOGFILE to /dev/null.

GRAFT-IGNORE    = .nograft
GRAFT-EXCLUDE   = .graft-exclude
GRAFT-INCLUDE   = .graft-include

                These variables hold the names of the special Graft files
                that control whether or not subdirectories or files are
                grafted. If you change these values, try to choose obvious
                names. If you want the files to appear in a simple
                directory listing, do not use file names that begin with a
                dot "." character.

GRAFT-NEVER     =

                This variable holds the names of the files and/or
                directories that should never be grafted. Typically these
                may be source code repositories as used by systems such as
                CVS, or perhaps lockfiles. The default value is empty but
                if you wish to specify values, simply add them to the
                variable using only whitespace as a separator. For
                example:

GRAFT-NEVER     = CVS RCS SCCS .lock

NEVERGRAFT      = 0

                If this variable is set to 1, the files and/or directories
                specified by GRAFT-NEVER will be automatically excluded
                from the grafted directory.

                If this variable is set to 0, the files and/or directories
                specified by GRAFT-NEVER will be not be excluded from the
                grafted directory.

                The sense of this value is reversed by use of the -C
                command line option.

                The automatic exclusion is bypassed completely if the
                grafted directory contains either a .nograft or
                .graft-include file.

PRUNED-SUFFIX   = .pruned

                This variable sets the suffix name of pruned files. Pruned
                files will be renamed filename.pruned.

SUPERUSER       = 1

                If this variable is set to 1 only the superuser can
                install, delete or prune packages. This can be overridden
                by a command line option. If this variable is set to 0,
                superuser privileges are not required and the override
                command line option is disabled.

                If you are installing a private copy of Graft to manage
                packages in your home directory you should set SUPERUSER
                to 0. If you're using Graft to manage a global set of
                packages you should set SUPERUSER to 1.

PRESERVEPERMS   = 0

                When grafting packages, Graft will create new directories
                as required. By setting PRESERVEPERMS to 1, the original
                user id, group id and file modes will be carried over to
                the new directory. This variable is used only if SUPERUSER
                is set to 1. The sense of this variable can be reversed
                using a command line option.

DELETEOBJECTS   = 0

                When deleting grafted packages, Graft may leave empty
                directories. Setting DELETEOBJECTS to 1 will allow Graft
                to delete these directories. If DELETEOBJECTS is 0 then
                Graft will display an appropriate message reminding the
                user that a directory has been emptied. The sense of this
                variable can be reversed using a command line option.

                It's probably not good practise to set this value to 1 as
                some directories may be used as place holders by a number
                of different packages. If the value is set to 0 deletion
                of directories can be forced via a command line option.

                When pruning packages, graft can either remove conflicting
                files or rename them. If DELETEOBJECTS is set to 1 the
                default prune action will be to delete conflicting
                objects. If DELETEOBJECTS is set to 0 the default prune
                action will be to rename conflicting objects. The sense of
                this variable can be reversed using a command line option.

       Save your changes and exit from the editor.
    5. Remove any existing executables by running:
    make clean

       You should see output similar to:
    rm -f graft

    6. Create the Graft executable by running:
    make

       You should see output similar to:
    /usr/bin/perl -wc graft.pl
    graft.pl syntax OK
    sed                                         \

        < graft.man > graft.1

    7. If you're using the automounter under Solaris 2.x, the installation
       process may not be able to directly create the directory specified
       by TOP. If this is the case then manually create this directory
       using whatever procedures are appropriate for your operating
       system.
       For example, if the /pkgs mount point is under the control of the
       automounter via an entry in the auto_pkgs map:
    *   nfshost:/export/sparc-SunOS-5.5.1/pkgs/&

       you'll need to create the Graft installation directory by executing
       the following command on the machine nfshost:
    mkdir /export/sparc-SunOS-5.5.1/pkgs/graft-2.6

    8. Install the Graft executable, manual page and documentation by
       executing:
    make install

       You should see output similar to:
    mkdir -p /pkgs/graft-2.6/bin
    cp graft /pkgs/graft-2.6/bin

    for i in graft.1;                                   \
    do                                                  \
        manpage=`basename $i`;                          \
        man=`expr $i : '.*\.\(.\)'`;                    \
        mkdir -p /pkgs/graft-2.6/man/man$man;           \
        cp $i /pkgs/graft-2.6/man/man$man/$manpage;     \
        chmod 644 /pkgs/graft-2.6/man/man$man/$manpage; \
    done

    for i in graft.html graft.pdf graft.ps graft.txt;   \
    do                                                  \
        mkdir -p /pkgs/graft-2.6/doc;                   \
        cp doc/$i /pkgs/graft-2.6/doc;                  \
        chmod 644 /pkgs/graft-2.6/doc/$i;               \
        touch /pkgs/graft-2.6/doc/.nograft;             \
    done

   Graft is now installed and ready to be used.

   NOTE: If you make changes to your Graft installation at a later date,
   please run the following commands:
    make clean
    make install

   Failure to do this may result in a Graft manual page that does NOT
   reflect your current configuration.

Grafting Graft and Perl - the bootstrap problem

   If you are using an operating system that comes with Perl 5.x - such as
   RedHat or Ubuntu Linux - then you don't need to worry about grafting
   Perl, so this section can be ignored.

   Embedded into the Graft executable is the location of the Perl
   executable. If you've understood the concept behind Graft then this
   location may be the grafted location of Perl rather than the true
   location of Perl.

   This presents a dilemma when you come to graft both Graft and Perl. You
   can't run the grafted location of the Graft executable because it
   doesn't exist yet, and you can't run the real location of the Graft
   executable because Perl hasn't been grafted yet.

   Assuming that Graft and Perl are installed in
    /pkgs/graft-2.6
    /pkgs/perl-5.18.2

   you can resolve this dilemma by executing the following commands:
    /pkgs/perl-5.18.2/bin/perl /pkgs/graft-2.6/bin/graft -i graft-2.6
    /pkgs/perl-5.18.2/bin/perl /pkgs/graft-2.6/bin/graft -i perl-5.18.2

   This will graft both Graft and Perl from the default package
   installation directory (as specified by PACKAGEDIR in the Makefile)
   into your default target directory (as specified by TARGETDIR in the
   Makefile).

   If you don't wish to use the default directories you can use the
   following commands instead:
    /pkgs/perl-5.18.2/bin/perl /pkgs/graft-2.6/bin/graft -i -t /pkgs /pkgs/graft
-2.6
    /pkgs/perl-5.18.2/bin/perl /pkgs/graft-2.6/bin/graft -i -t /pkgs /pkgs/perl-
5.18.2

   Now both Graft and Perl have been grafted and any other package can be
   grafted by executing the simpler command:
    graft -i package

   The Graft 2.6 distribution includes a program called graftBootStrap.sh
   which allows you to easily graft both Graft and Perl. It can be found
   in the contrib directory of the distribution.
     __________________________________________________________________

Using Graft

  Compiling Packages

   Any packages you wish to place under the control of Graft should be
   compiled and installed in such a way that any package dependent files
   are referenced with the ACTUAL package installation directory rather
   than the common area in which Graft will be creating symbolic links.
   For example, ensure that Perl version 5.18.2 is looking for its library
   files in /pkgs/perl-5.18.2/lib/perl5 instead of /pkgs/lib/perl5. This
   approach will allow you to easily separate multiple versions of the
   same package without any problems.
                              _________________

  Graft command line options

   All of the details concerning actions, package locations and target
   directories are passed to Graft on the command line. (Graft 1.x used a
   configuration file. This has now been deprecated in favour of a log
   file).

   Graft's command line options can be summarised as:
    graft -i [-P|u] [-l log] [-n] [-v|V] [-s|-t target] package(s)
    graft -d [-D] [-u] [-l log] [-n] [-v|V] [-s|-t target] package(s)
    graft -p [-D] [-u] [-l log] [-n] [-v|V] [-s|-t target] package(s)

   Graft has three basic actions:
    1. Install
    graft -i [-C] [-P|u] [-l log] [-n] [-v|V] [-s|-t target] package(s)

        -i

                Install symbolic links from the package installation
                directory to the target directory. Requires superuser
                privileges if SUPERUSER was set to 1 in the Makefile.

        -C

                If NEVERGRAFT was set to 1 in the Makefile, disable the
                automatic exclusion of files and/or directories whose
                names exactly match the values specified by GRAFT-NEVER in
                the Makefile.

                If NEVERGRAFT was set to 0 in the Makefile, force the
                automatic exclusion of files and/or directories whose
                names exactly match the values specified by GRAFT-NEVER in
                the Makefile.

                Can only be used with the -i option.

                This option is ignored for each grafted directory, if the
                directory contains a .nograft or .graft-include file.

                The Graft manual page will correctly reflect the status of
                this option based on the values specified in the Makefile.

        -P

                Preserve modes and ownerships when creating new
                directories if PRESERVEPERMS was set to 0 in the Makefile.
                Do not preserve modes and ownerships if the option is not
                provided on the command line.

                Do not preserve modes and ownerships when creating new
                directories if PRESERVEPERMS was set to 1 in the Makefile.
                Preserve modes and ownerships if the option is not
                provided on the command line.

                Cannot be used with the -u option.

                This option will be silently ignored if the effective user
                of Graft is not root.

                This option does not apply if SUPERUSER was set to 0 in
                the Makefile.

                The Graft manual page will correctly reflect the status of
                this option based on the values specified in the Makefile.

        -u

                Superuser privileges are not required when installing
                packages.

                Cannot be used with the -P option.

                This option is only available if SUPERUSER was set to 1 in
                the Makefile.

                The Graft manual page will correctly reflect the status of
                this option based on the values specified in the Makefile.

        -l log

                Specify an alternate log file instead of the default
                specified by LOGFILE in the Makefile. No logging is
                performed if the -n option is used.

                Log entries have the form:

    878790215   1.10+   I    /pkgs/cpio-2.4.2            /pkgs
    878888916   2.1     I    /pkgs/gzip-1.2.4            /pkgs
    878888916   2.1     IC   /pkgs/gzip-1.2.4/bin/gzip   invalid symlink

                This shows that a development version of graft (1.10+) was
                used to install symbolic links from /pkgs/cpio-2.4.2 to
                /pkgs. A new version of graft (2.1) was used to install
                symbolic links from /pkgs/gzip-1.2.4 to /pkgs. The IC
                entry indicates that a conflict occurred during this
                installation - the file /pkgs/bin/gzip was a symbolic link
                to something other than /pkgs/gzip-1.2.4/bin/gzip.

        -n

                List actions but do not perform them. Implies the very
                verbose option. Does not require superuser privileges
                regardless of the value of SUPERUSER in the Makefile.

        -v

                Be verbose.

        -V

                Be very verbose.

        -s

                Stow/Depot compatibility mode. Infer the Graft target
                directory from each package installation directory in the
                manner of Stow and Depot.

                Target directory is the dirname of the dirname of the
                package installation directory. (Yes that really is two
                dirnames). So if the package installation directory is

    /usr/local/depot/gzip-1.2.4

                the package will be grafted into

    /usr/local

                Cannot be used with the -t option.

        -t target

                Override the default graft target directory with target.
                The value of target must be a fully qualified directory
                and it must exist.

                Cannot be used with the -s option.

        package

                Install the named package. If package is a fully qualified
                directory, use it as the package installation directory.
                If package is not a fully qualified directory, prepend it
                with the value of PACKAGEDIR as specified in the Makefile.
                                     ______

    2. Delete
    graft -d [-D] [-u] [-l log] [-n] [-v|V] [-s|-t target] package(s)

        -d

                Delete symbolic links from the package target directory to
                the package installation directory. Requires superuser
                privileges if SUPERUSER was set to 1 in the Makefile.

        -D

                Delete empty directories if DELETEOBJECTS was set to 0 in
                the Makefile. If the option is not provided on the command
                line, notify the user that a directory has been emptied.

                Do not delete empty directories if DELETEOBJECTS was set
                to 1 in the Makefile. Notify the user that a directory has
                been emptied. If the option is not provided on the command
                line, delete empty directories.

                The Graft manual page will correctly reflect the status of
                this option based on the values specified in the Makefile.

        -u

                Superuser privileges are not required when deleting
                packages.

                This option is only available if SUPERUSER was set to 1 in
                the Makefile.

                The Graft manual page will correctly reflect the status of
                this option based on the values specified in the Makefile.

        -l log

                Specify an alternate log file instead of the default
                specified by LOGFILE in the Makefile. No logging is
                performed if the -n option is used.

                Log entries have the form:

    879126278       1.10+   D       /pkgs/weblint-1.017     /pkgs
    879126278       1.10+   DC      /pkgs/weblint-1.017/bin/weblint  file exists
    879126278       1.10+   DC      /pkgs/weblint-1.017/man/man1/weblint.1  file
 exists

                This shows that a development version of graft (1.10+) was
                used to delete symbolic links from /pkgs to
                /pkgs/weblint-1.017. The DC entries indicate that
                conflicts occurred during this action - the files
                /pkgs/bin/weblint and /pkgs/man/man1/weblint.1 already
                exist.

        -n

                List actions but do not perform them. Implies the very
                verbose option. Does not require superuser privileges
                regardless of the value of SUPERUSER in the Makefile.

        -v

                Be verbose.

        -V

                Be very verbose.

        -s

                Stow/Depot compatibility mode. Infer the Graft target
                directory from each package installation directory in the
                manner of Stow and Depot.

                Target directory is the dirname of the dirname of the
                package installation directory. (Yes that really is two
                dirnames). So if the package installation directory is

    /usr/local/depot/gzip-1.2.4

                the package will be grafted into

    /usr/local

                Cannot be used with the -t option.

        -t target

                Override the default graft target directory with target.
                The value of target must be a fully qualified directory
                and it must exist.

                Cannot be used with the -s option.

        package

                Delete the named package. If package is a fully qualified
                directory, use it as the package installation directory.
                If package is not a fully qualified directory, prepend it
                with the value of PACKAGEDIR as specified in the Makefile.

    3. Prune
    graft -p [-D] [-u] [-l log] [-n] [-v|V] [-s|-t target] package(s)

        -p

                Prune objects (files, links or directories) from the
                package target directory that are in conflict with the
                package installation directory. Requires superuser
                privileges if SUPERUSER was set to 1 in the Makefile.

        -D

                Remove conflicting objects if DELETEOBJECTS was set to 0
                in the Makefile. Rename conflicting objects as
                object.pruned if the option is not provided on the command
                line.

                Rename conflicting objects to object.pruned if
                DELETEOBJECTS was set to 1 in the Makefile. Remove
                conflicting objects if the option is not provided in the
                command line.

                If a directory is to be removed and it is not empty, it
                will be renamed as dir.pruned and a suitable warning
                message will be given regardless of the sense of this
                flag.

                The Graft manual page will correctly reflect the status of
                this option based on the values specified in the Makefile.

        -u

                Superuser privileges are not required when pruning
                packages.

                This option is only available if SUPERUSER was set to 1 in
                the Makefile.

        -l log

                Specify an alternate log file instead of the default
                specified by LOGFILE in the Makefile. No logging is
                performed if the -n option is used.

                Log entries have the form:

    879126283       1.10+   P       /pkgs/weblint-1.017     /pkgs

                This shows that a development version of graft (1.10+) was
                used to delete objects from /pkgs that were in conflict
                with /pkgs/weblint-1.017.

        -n

                List actions but do not perform them. Implies the very
                verbose option. Does not require superuser privileges
                regardless of the value of SUPERUSER in the Makefile.

        -v

        -t target

                Override the default graft target directory with target.
                The value of target must be a fully qualified directory
                and it must exist.

                Cannot be used with the -s option.

        package

                Prune the named package. If package is a fully qualified
                directory, use it as the package installation directory.
                If package is not a fully qualified directory, prepend it
                with the value of PACKAGEDIR as specified in the Makefile.

  Testing the Graft Installation

   Before creating the symbolic links from the target directory to the
   package directory, you may wish to see what actions Graft will perform.
   Execute the following command:
    graft -i -n package-name

   The -i option tells Graft to install the package and the -n option
   tells Graft to report on its actions without actually performing them.
   The default Graft target directory will be used and the package
   installation directory will be taken from the fully qualified package
   argument or the default value will be prepended to the package argument
   if it is not fully qualified.

   Graft will report on the following actions:
     * Installing links to package-location in package-target
       Indicates the real package location and its grafted target.
     * Processing package-directory
       Indicates which package directory is being processed.
     * MKDIR dirname
       This destination directory will be created.
     * SYMLINK dest-package-file -> package-file
       This symbolic link will be created.
     * NOP string
       No action was necessary for this package object.
     * BYPASS dirname - .nograft file found
       This directory contains a file called .nograft so its contents and
       any subdirectories will be bypassed by Graft.
     * READING include file package-dir/.graft-include
       The directory currently being processed by Graft contains a file
       called .graft-include which contains a list of file and/or
       directory names from the directory that should only be grafted. The
       contents of this file are being read by Graft.
     * INCLUDE file package-file - listed in package-dir/.graft-include
       The file name mentioned in this message appears in the
       .graft-include file and the file exists in the directory currently
       being processed. It will be grafted.
     * IGNORE file package-file - not listed in package-dir/.graft-include
       The file name mentioned in this message does not appear in the
       .graft-include file and the file exists in the directory currently
       being processed. It will not be grafted.
     * INCLUDE directory package-directory - listed in
       package-dir/.graft-include
       The directory name mentioned in this message appears in the
       .graft-include file and the directory exists in the directory
       currently being processed. It will be grafted.
     * IGNORE directory package-file - not listed in
       package-dir/.graft-include
       The directory name mentioned in this message does not appear in the
       .graft-include file and the directory exists in the directory
       currently being processed. It will not be grafted.
     * READING exclude file package-dir/.graft-exclude
       The directory currently being processed by Graft contains a file
       called .graft-exclude which contains a list of file and/or
       directory names from the directory that should not be grafted. The
       contents of this file are being read by Graft.
     * IGNORE include file package-dir/.graft-include, overridden by
       exclude file package-dir/.graft-exclude
       The directory currently being processed by Graft contains a file
       called .graft-exclude as well as a file called .graft-include. The
       .graft-exclude file takes precedence over the .graft-include file,
       so the latter file will be ignored.
     * EXCLUDE file package-file - listed in package-dir/.graft-exclude
       The file name mentioned in this message appears in the
       .graft-exclude file and the file exists in the directory currently
       being processed. It will not be grafted.
     * EXCLUDE directory package-directory - listed in
       package-dir/.graft-exclude
       The directory name mentioned in this message appears in the
       .graft-exclude file and the directory exists in the directory
       currently being processed. It will not be grafted.
     * CONFLICT message
       Graft could not successfully process a package object. One of the
       following conditions was encountered:
          + The package object is a directory and the target object exists
            but it not a directory.
          + The package object is not a directory and the target object
            exists and is not a symbolic link.
          + The package object is not a directory and the target object
            exists and is a symbolic link to something other than the
            package object.
       Conflicts are ALWAYS reported on standard error. If you wish to see
       if the installation of a package will have any conflicts, you can
       execute:
    graft -i -n package-name > /dev/null

       Only CONFLICT messages will be displayed. If nothing is displayed
       then you can safely conclude that this package can be installed
       using Graft without any conflicts.

   If you were to test the installation of the kermit-5A190 package you
   would execute the command:
    graft -i -n kermit-5A190

   You should see output resembling:

    SYMLINK      /pkgs/lib/ckurzsz.ini -> /pkgs/kermit-5A190/lib/ckurzsz.ini

   This output shows you that most of the directories already exist
   (indicated by the NOP flags). A symbolic link will be created in the
   relevant target directory to each of the files in the kermit-5A190
   package. One directory exists in the kermit-5A190 package that does not
   exist in the target - doc. This directory will be created by Graft.

   NOTE: If you are using the automounter you may not be able to create
   the directory /pkgs/doc. You'll have to create the directory on the NFS
   server under the file system in which it really lives. You should be
   familiar with the peculiarities of the automounter and your specific
   site configuration before creating any directories directly under mount
   points used by the automounter.
                              _________________

  Installing Packages

   Once you have ensured that Graft will perform the correct actions, you
   can execute:
    graft -i package-name

   So to install kermit you would execute:
    graft -i kermit-5A190

   There will be no output from Graft unless it encounters a conflict. If
   you wish to see more information you can specify one of the verbose
   flags. For a minimum of output you can execute:
    graft -i -v kermit-5A190

   You should see the following output:
    Processing   /pkgs/kermit-5A190
    Processing   /pkgs/kermit-5A190/bin
    Processing   /pkgs/kermit-5A190/man
    Processing   /pkgs/kermit-5A190/man/man1
    Processing   /pkgs/kermit-5A190/doc
    Processing   /pkgs/kermit-5A190/lib

   If you choose the very verbose option by executing:
    graft -i -V kermit-5A190

   the output will be the same as that when the -n option was used,
   however this time Graft will actually create the symbolic links.

   NOTE: In this case the /pkgs/doc directory was not created by Graft
   because /pkgs is a mount point controlled by the automounter. The doc
   directory was created manually prior to executing Graft.
                              _________________

  Bypassing package directories

   You may have the need to place only part of a package under the control
   of Graft. Examples of such occasions may be:
     * The contents of one package conflict with another package. For
       example /pkgs/gcc-2.7.2.1/lib/libiberty.a and
       /pkgs/gdb-4.16/lib/libiberty.a.
     * A package directory is obviously the exclusive domain of the
       package and no benefit will be gained by creating symbolic links to
       its files. For example /pkgs/perl-5.18.2/lib/perl5.
       NOTE: This will ONLY work if you originally compiled and installed
       the package such that it refers to its files by their 'real'
       pathnames and NOT by the virtual pathnames provided by Graft.

   You can force Graft to bypass a directory by creating the file
    package-name/dir/dir/.nograft

   Using the second example above, if you were to create the file:
    /pkgs/perl-5.18.2/lib/perl5/.nograft

   Graft would create directories and symbolic links for every file and
   directory down to /pkgs/perl-5.18.2/lib. The perl5 directory and
   anything below it would not be created.
                              _________________

  Including specific files and/or directories

   There may be the occasional need to include specific files and/or
   directories in a directory, rather than the entire directory tree
   itself. An example of such an occurrence would be the case where a
   package contains a number of subdirectories, only one of which is
   required to be grafted.

   You can force Graft to only include any number of files and/or
   directories in a package directory by creating the file
    .graft-include

   in the same directory.

   .graft-include will contain a list of file and/or directory names - one
   per line - of the files and/or directories you wish to include.

   Consider the a2ps package for example. When installed it contains the
   following directories:
    /pkgs/a2ps-4.13b/bin
    /pkgs/a2ps-4.13b/etc
    /pkgs/a2ps-4.13b/include
    /pkgs/a2ps-4.13b/info
    /pkgs/a2ps-4.13b/lib
    /pkgs/a2ps-4.13b/man
    /pkgs/a2ps-4.13b/share

   The only directory you wish to graft is the bin directory. You could
   place a .nograft file in each of the other directories, OR you could
   create a single .graft-include file in /pkgs/a2ps-4.13b/.graft-include.
   This file would contain
    bin

   Now only the bin directory will be grafted.
                              _________________

  Excluding specific files and/or directories

   There may be the occasional need to exclude specific files and/or
   directories from a directory, rather than the entire directory itself.
   An example of such an occurrence would be the case where files from
   different packages have the same name. Emacs and Xemacs use the same
   names for a number of their configuration files for example.

   You can force Graft to exclude any number of files and/or directories
   from a package directory by creating the file
    .graft-exclude

   in the same directory.

   .graft-exclude will contain a list of file and/or directory names - one
   per line - of the files and/or directories you wish to exclude.

   For example, if you did not wish the file
    /pkgs/sudo-1.5.3/etc/sudoers

   to be grafted as
    /pkgs/etc/sudoers

   but you did want
    /pkgs/sudo-1.5.3/etc/visudo

   to be grafted as
    /pkgs/etc/visudo

   you would create the file
    /pkgs/sudo-1.5.3/etc/.graft-exclude

   and ensure its contents contained the line:
    sudoers

   NOTE: Any entries made in a .graft-exclude file will override the same
   entries made in a .graft-include file. That is, if a file or directory
   name is listen in both a .graft-exclude and a .graft-include file, it
   will be excluded from the graft.
                              _________________

  Grafting part of a package

   Some packages can be successfully used when only part of their
   installation directory is grafted. Other packages are recalcitrant and
   need some special hand holding which can only be solved by grafting
   each section of the package separately.

   The first scenario can be handled by either .nograft files or partial
   grafts. Consider Perl version 5.18.2. When installed in its own
   directory
    /pkgs/perl-5.18.2

   there are three subdirectories
    drwxr-sr-x   2 psamuel  bisg         512 Oct 30  1996 bin
    drwxr-sr-x   3 psamuel  bisg         512 Oct 30  1996 lib
    drwxr-sr-x   4 psamuel  bisg         512 Oct 30  1996 man

   Everything in the lib directory is exclusive to Perl and does not
   require grafting. Therefore, perl-5.18.2 can be grafted using either of
   the following two methods:
    touch /pkgs/perl-5.18.2/lib/.nograft
    graft -i perl-5.18.2

   or
    graft -it /pkgs/bin perl-5.18.2/bin
    graft -it /pkgs/man perl-5.18.2/man

   Now let's consider a recalcitrant package - ObjectStore version
   4.0.2.a.0. When installed in
    /pkgs/ostore-4.0.2.a.0

   the following files and directories are available:
    -rwxrwxr-x   1 pauln    one3        1089 Oct 31  1996 Copyright
    drwxrwxrwx   8 pauln    one3         512 Oct  2  1996 common
    drwxrwxrwx   6 pauln    one3         512 Oct 31  1996 sunpro
    -rw-r-----   1 root     one3     1900544 Apr 29  1997 txn.log

   The executable programs that need to be grafted are in sunpro/bin and
   the manual pages that need to be grafted are in common/man. Everything
   else in the package does not need to be grafted. If the entire package
   was to be grafted the result would be two directories that are not in
   the regular $PATH and $MANPATH environment variables - namely
   /pkgs/common/man and /pkgs/sunpro/bin, plus a host of other directories
   that are not relevant for grafting. No amount of .nograft and
   .graft-exclude juggling will solve this problem.

   The solution is to use two partial grafts:
    graft -it /pkgs/bin ostore-4.0.2.a.0/sunpro/bin
    graft -it /pkgs/man ostore-4.0.2.a.0/common/bin

   Using this approach, the correct executables and manual pages are
   available without the need to graft unnecessary files and directories.

  Deleting and/or Upgrading Packages

   If you wish to upgrade a package - let's assume you wish to upgrade
   kermit from version 5A190 to version 6.0.192 - you'd follow these
   steps.

   Firstly, you'd compile and install kermit-6.0.192 in
    /pkgs/kermit-6.0.192

   Once you'd tested it to your satisfaction, you'd need to delete the
   symbolic links to the current grafted version. You can check which
   actions Graft will perform by executing:
    graft -d -n kermit-5A190

   You'll see output similar to
    Uninstalling links from /pkgs to /pkgs/kermit-5A190
    Processing   /pkgs/kermit-5A190
    Processing   /pkgs/kermit-5A190/bin
    UNLINK       /pkgs/bin/kermit
    UNLINK       /pkgs/bin/wart
    Processing   /pkgs/kermit-5A190/man
    Processing   /pkgs/kermit-5A190/man/man1
    UNLINK       /pkgs/man/man1/kermit.1
    Processing   /pkgs/kermit-5A190/doc
    UNLINK       /pkgs/doc/ckccfg.doc
    UNLINK       /pkgs/doc/ckuins.doc
    UNLINK       /pkgs/doc/ckc190.upd
    UNLINK       /pkgs/doc/ckcker.upd
    UNLINK       /pkgs/doc/ckaaaa.hlp
    UNLINK       /pkgs/doc/ckuaaa.hlp
    Processing   /pkgs/kermit-5A190/lib
    UNLINK       /pkgs/lib/ckedemo.ini
    UNLINK       /pkgs/lib/ckeracu.ini
    UNLINK       /pkgs/lib/ckermit.ini
    UNLINK       /pkgs/lib/ckermod.ini
    UNLINK       /pkgs/lib/cketest.ini
    UNLINK       /pkgs/lib/ckevt.ini
    UNLINK       /pkgs/lib/ckurzsz.ini
    UNLINK       /pkgs/lib/.testing

   If you're happy with the output from the test deletion you can delete
   the grafted package. Once again, you'll only see output if a failure
   occurs unless you use one of the verbose options.

   If you execute:
    graft -dV kermit-5A190

   you'll see:
    Uninstalling links from /pkgs to /pkgs/kermit-5A190
    Processing   /pkgs/kermit-5A190
    Processing   /pkgs/kermit-5A190/bin
    UNLINK       /pkgs/bin/kermit
    UNLINK       /pkgs/bin/wart
    Processing   /pkgs/kermit-5A190/man
    Processing   /pkgs/kermit-5A190/man/man1
    UNLINK       /pkgs/man/man1/kermit.1
    Processing   /pkgs/kermit-5A190/doc
    UNLINK       /pkgs/doc/ckccfg.doc
    UNLINK       /pkgs/doc/ckuins.doc
    UNLINK       /pkgs/doc/ckc190.upd
    UNLINK       /pkgs/doc/ckcker.upd
    UNLINK       /pkgs/doc/ckaaaa.hlp
    UNLINK       /pkgs/doc/ckuaaa.hlp
    EMPTY        /pkgs/doc is now empty. Delete manually if necessary.
    Processing   /pkgs/kermit-5A190/lib
    UNLINK       /pkgs/lib/ckedemo.ini
    UNLINK       /pkgs/lib/ckeracu.ini
    UNLINK       /pkgs/lib/ckermit.ini
    UNLINK       /pkgs/lib/ckermod.ini
    UNLINK       /pkgs/lib/cketest.ini
    UNLINK       /pkgs/lib/ckevt.ini
    UNLINK       /pkgs/lib/ckurzsz.ini

   NOTE: In this case the existence of an empty directory has been
   discovered. If Graft empties a directory during a package deletion, it
   will either notify you or delete the directory depending on the
   combination of variables in the Makefile and command line options. It's
   probably better practise not to automatically delete empty directories
   as they may be used by other packages - such as lock file directories
   for example.

   Now you can remove the real package contents. (You may not wish to do
   this immediately as some legacy systems may depend on features provided
   by the older version or you may feel the need for further testing
   before feeling confident that the old version can be removed):
    rm -rf /pkgs/kermit-5A190

   Now you can graft the new version of kermit. Execute:
    graft -i -n kermit-6.0.192

   to ensure that the grafting will proceed without error. Once you are
   satisfied that this is the case you can graft the new package by
   executing:
    graft -i kermit-6.0.192
                              _________________

  Transitioning a package to Graft control

   Graft can be used to easily transition a package from its current
   installation in your target directory to a grafted installation.

   As an example, let's consider the package weblint version 1.017. It
   consists of three files installed in:
    /usr/local/bin/weblint
    /usr/local/lib/global.weblintrc
    /usr/local/man/man1/weblint.1

   The first step is to create a new copy of the package in its own
   directory:
    /pkgs/weblint-1.017

   Ensure that any references to library files are now made to
   /pkgs/weblint-1.017/lib instead of /usr/local/lib.

   Test the new installation to ensure it behaves as expected.

   Then prune the old files from /usr/local/* using:
    graft -pVt /usr/local weblint-1.017

   You'd expect to see output similar to:
    Pruning      files in /usr/local which conflict with /pkgs/weblint-1.017
    Processing   /pkgs/weblint-1.017
    Processing   /pkgs/weblint-1.017/man
    Processing   /pkgs/weblint-1.017/man/man1
    RENAME       /usr/local/man/man1/weblint.1
    Processing   /pkgs/weblint-1.017/bin
    RENAME       /usr/local/bin/weblint
    Processing   /pkgs/weblint-1.017/lib
    RENAME       /usr/local/lib/global.weblintrc

   If you elected to delete conflicting files instead of renaming them
   you'd use:
    graft -pDVt /usr/local weblint-1.017

   and you'd see output similar to:
    Pruning      files in /usr/local which conflict with /pkgs/weblint-1.017
    Processing   /pkgs/weblint-1.017
    Processing   /pkgs/weblint-1.017/man
    Processing   /pkgs/weblint-1.017/man/man1
    UNLINK       /usr/local/man/man1/weblint.1
    Processing   /pkgs/weblint-1.017/bin
    UNLINK       /usr/local/bin/weblint
    Processing   /pkgs/weblint-1.017/lib
    UNLINK       /usr/local/lib/global.weblintrc

   Now the new version of weblint 1.017 can be grafted in place:
    graft -it /usr/local weblint-1.017

   The grafted version of weblint can now be tested.

   If we renamed conflicting files, they can be removed once the grafted
   weblint has been satisfactorily tested:
    rm /usr/local/man/man1/weblint.1.pruned
    rm /usr/local/bin/weblint.pruned
    rm /usr/local/lib/global.weblintrc.pruned
                              _________________

  Conflict Processing

   Occasionally Graft will fail to completely install a package. This
   occurs because Graft encounters a conflict. A conflict is defined as
   one of the following possibilities:

   Package Object                      Target Object
   directory      not a directory
   file           directory
   file           file
   file           symbolic link to something other than the package object

   If Graft encounters such a conflict during the installation of a
   package it will report the conflict and exit.

   Resolving the conflict depends on the nature of the conflict and is
   beyond the scope of this discussion - however most conflicts will
   either be the result of attempting to graft a package on top of the
   same package actually installed in the target directory or a file name
   clash between two (or more) different packages.

   Conflicts arising from the pre-existence of a package in the target
   directory can be resolved using graft's prune mechanism described above
   in [34]"Transitioning a package to Graft control".

   File name clash conflicts can be resolved by the use of either a
   [35].nograft or [36].graft-exclude file or by grafting only part of a
   package as described above in [37]"Grafting part of a package".

   If Graft encounters a conflict while deleting a package, it will report
   the conflict and continue deleting the remainder of the package. In
   this way Graft will delete as much of the package as possible.
   Conflicts that arise during deletion will probably be the result of an
   incorrectly installed package or the installation of other components
   of the same package without the use of Graft.

   Conflict messages are written to standard error. All other messages are
   written to standard output. To quickly determine if a package will have
   any conflicts when grafted, redirect standard output to standard error:
    graft -i -n package > /dev/null

   If you don't see any output then you can safely assume that there will
   be no conflicts when grafting this package.
                              _________________

  Exit Status

   Graft will terminate with an exit status of either 0, 1, 2 or 3 under
   the following conditions:

   Exit Status Condition

                                      0

   All operations succeeded.

                                      1

   A conflict occurred during installation.

                                      2

   Command line syntax was incorrect.

                                      3

   One or more packages listed on the command line does not exist. Other
   valid packages listed on the command line were processed correctly.
     __________________________________________________________________

Using Graft with other package management tools

   Most Unix vendors have released their own package management tools with
   their operating systems. Examples of this are Solaris 2.x with its SVR4
   Package Manager pkgadd, RedHat Linux with its RedHat Package Manager
   rpm, Ubuntu Linux (and other Debian Linux derivatives) with its dpkg
   system and HP-UX 10.x with its swinstall suite. Graft has been designed
   as an adjunct to these package managers rather than a competitor. The
   author has used Graft successfully with all of the operating systems
   mentioned here.
     * Many useful packages available in the public domain and from other
       commercial sources are not shipped with most flavours of Unix.
       Graft can be used to maintain a rich package environment beyond the
       set of packages provided by your vendor. Vendor based packages can
       still be maintained using the vendor's tools and Graft can be used
       to maintain your own packages.
     * The vendor based management tools are usually used to maintain
       single instances of a package on each machine. It is often
       difficult to have multiple versions of the same package coexisting
       on the same machine. Graft can be used to maintain multiple
       versions of a package to support legacy, production and development
       requirements simultaneously.
     * Another common problem with vendor supplied software is the speed
       at which upgrades are available. The large vendors are not known
       for providing quick fixes to many of their packages. (Notable
       exceptions to this are the vendors of operating systems based on
       open source software who can draw on the enormous number of users
       who submit patches because the source code is available). Using
       Graft you can obtain a working public domain version of a package
       (if one exists of course) and install it in a different location to
       the vendor copy. When the vendor releases a new version of the
       package, it can be installed using the vendor's package management
       tool and your grafted copy can be removed (only if the vendor's
       version of the package is better than the public domain version).
     * Sometimes, a vendor's package doesn't quite perform in the manner
       you'd like. It may be making assumptions about your file system(s)
       that are incorrect for your environment or it may not have all the
       features you'd like. If an alternative package is available -
       either in the public domain or from other commercial sources - it
       can be installed and grafted accordingly.
